# Python-ROS---Delivery-Robot
The aim of this project is to develop an on-demand autonomous delivery service using a navigation robot. The service will be coded in Gazebo ROS and Python, and will be designed to autonomously deliver food, grocery, and parcels from initial location and then dispatch for the delivery location and auto navigation channels agent to the drop-off location.
